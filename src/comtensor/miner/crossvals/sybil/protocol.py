    """
    Challenge is a specialized implementation of the `StreamingSynapse` tailored for prompting functionalities within
    the Bittensor network. This class is intended to interact with a streaming response that contains a sequence of tokens,
    which represent prompts or messages in a certain scenario.

    As a developer, when using or extending the `Challenge` class, you should be primarily focused on the structure
    and behavior of the prompts you are working with. The class has been designed to seamlessly handle the streaming,
    decoding, and accumulation of tokens that represent these prompts.

    Attributes:
    - `sources` (List[str]): A list of sources related to the query. Immutable.

    - `query` (str): The query to be sent to the Bittensor network. Immutable.

    - `seed` (int): The seed used to generate the output. Immutable.

    - `completion` (str): Stores the processed result of the streaming tokens. As tokens are streamed, decoded, and
                          processed, they are accumulated in the completion attribute. This represents the "final"
                          product or result of the streaming process.
    - `required_hash_fields` (List[str]): A list of fields that are required for the hash.

    Methods:
    - `process_streaming_response`: This method asynchronously processes the incoming streaming response by decoding
                                    the tokens and accumulating them in the `completion` attribute.

    - `deserialize`: Converts the `completion` attribute into its desired data format, in this case, a string.

    - `extract_response_json`: Extracts relevant JSON data from the response, useful for gaining insights on the response's
                               metadata or for debugging purposes.

    Note: While you can directly use the `Challenge` class, it's designed to be extensible. Thus, you can create
    subclasses to further customize behavior for specific prompting scenarios or requirements.

        As the streaming response is consumed, the tokens are decoded from their 'utf-8' encoded format, split based on

        Beyond just extracting the JSON data, the method also processes and structures the data for easier consumption
        and understanding. For instance, it extracts specific headers related to dendrite and axon, offering insights
        about the Bittensor network's internal processes. The method ultimately returns a dictionary with a structured
        view of the extracted data.

        Args:
